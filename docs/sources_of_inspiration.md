# Thanks

Twitter has provided lots of info about working with [raw images from the Mars Perseverance](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/) mission.  Here's an incomplete/unordered list of those who have posted code and/or clues.

[Emily Lakdawalla](https://twitter.com/elakdawalla) is a general font of knowledge.  And she created a free online course for the Planetary Society, [Basics of Digital Imaging](https://courses.planetary.org/courses), that's centered on images from NASA planetary missions.

[Robert Cadena](https://twitter.com/robertcadena/)'s [Perseverance Raw Image Playground](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SqTzhMo5NeVNZ6YTwsSpsssLH3vp5vX_?usp=sharing) is a Jupyter notebook that lets you retrieve lists of images, download and manipulate them.  Among other things it shows how to interact with the raw image site's RSS feed

[Kevin Gill](http://twitter.com/kevinmgill) posted a link to his [fetch_m20_raw.py](https://github.com/kmgill/cassini_processing/blob/master/fetch_m20_raw.py) script, a command-line utility that provides even more clues about how to interact with the raw image site programmatically.

summarized a straightforward process for manually combining Perseverance raw images to create [RGB composite images](https://twitter.com/BeckePhysics/status/1363657930885771268):
> Christopher Becke - @BeckePhysics: BTW, an easy way to create color hazcam images:
>
> 1) download three images that look the same
> 2) look at the file name for the R, G, B after Mars_Perseverance_XX*
> 3) go to http://flaticon.sodhanalibrary.com/combine-rgb-chanels-online.html
> 4) drag the R, G, and B images to their proper location
> 5) voila!
